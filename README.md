# Energy flow visualizer for smart home project
## Project goal
The project will implement a mobile application to visualise energy flows provided by the energy meter server. The mobile application will provide views for the amount of instantaneous energy flows as well as views for historical energy flows.

The objective is to create a mobile application with React Native and EXPO framework to request and present hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly energy flows. The aim is to provide graphical visualization both to current power and historical energy flows. Since the energy meter system will operate inside a local network which is not exposed externally (no public IP address), the mobile application will use the free hosted MongoDB database directly to fetch historical data. Presentation of current data is only possible within local network.
